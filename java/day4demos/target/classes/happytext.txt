Let's make a nice big leafy tree. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Don't be bashful drop me a line.

Now, we're going to fluff this cloud. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities.

See how easy it is to create a little tree right in your world. We're trying to teach you a technique here and how to use it. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Nature is so fantastic, enjoy it. Let it make you happy.

Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out.

Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper. That's why I paint - because I can create the kind of world I want - and I can make this world as happy as I want it.

Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. Here we're limited by the time we have. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school.

In your world you can create anything you desire. Let your imagination be your guide. There we go.
