A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it. We don't really know where this goes - and
I'm not sure we really care. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen. We'll take
a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. There it is.

I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this
time.' And you may be right. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Maybe we got a few little
happy bushes here, just covered with snow. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.
