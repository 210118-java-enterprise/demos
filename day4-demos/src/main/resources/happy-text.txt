Let's get crazy. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. If you do too much it's going to lose its effectiveness. And I will hypnotize that just a little bit.

Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. Happy painting, God bless. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue Get tough with it, get strong. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun

The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. It's all a game of angles.

Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. There he comes. Put it in, leave it alone. Just a little indication. There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.

Maybe we got a few little happy bushes here, just covered with snow. We wash our brush with odorless thinner. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. The light is your friend. Preserve it. Zip. That easy.

Trees live in your fan brush, but you have to scare them out. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. Let's give him a friend too. Everybody needs a friend. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

Just think about these things in your mind - then bring them into your world. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. Here we're limited by the time we have. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. A happy cloud.
